Labor Tracking App
The Warehouse Labor Tracking application is a program designed to manage employee data and track their working hours in a warehouse setting. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing various tasks such as adding new employees, assigning shifts to employees, and retrieving labor data.

The application allows users to add new employees by entering their ID, name, and position. Employees can be assigned shifts by specifying the employee ID, shift ID, start time, and end time. The program verifies the existence of the employee before assigning the shift.

Labor data, including the total hours worked by each employee, can be retrieved by entering the employee ID. The application calculates the total hours worked based on the assigned shifts for the employee.

The Warehouse Labor Tracking application utilizes object-oriented programming principles and data structures to manage employee information and track labor data effectively. It provides a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing framework, making it easy for users to interact with the application and perform necessary tasks efficiently.
